Identicon generator written in Python. Takes a string argument and generates a unique avatar image, similar to GitHub's system. Created as a quick Python educational experiment.

Depends on PIL (Python Image Library).

#### Usage
```
[python] [id.py] test_string
```
Where [] represent the locations of python.exe and id.py. At the current stage, the input string may not contain spaces.
The image will be generated and displayed using your default image viewer. From here, you can save it to your disk.
